# E-NovelHunt
E-NovelHunt is a dynamic online novel reading platform developed as part of my 6th-semester project. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, C#, ASP.NET, and MySQL, it provides a seamless and secure reading experience for users. The repository contains all project files, including the codebase and revision history.
